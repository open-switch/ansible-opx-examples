# opx_acl - List of ACL operation
#    operation - optional - create, delete; default=create
#    acl_tbl_attr_data - optional - dict - ACL table attributes
#    acl_entries - optional - list of ACL entries
#
# acl_tbl_attr_data and acl_entries[x] must contain all the attributes as dict required for creation/deletion of CPS object.
#    If operation=delete, id must be provided in the vars
#
# acl_tbl_attr_data and acl_entries are optional parameters but either one or both can be provided at a time
#    If both are present and operation=create, first ACL table will be created and then entries will be created for that table.
#    If both are present and operation=delete, first all ACL entries will be deleted and then the table will be deleted.
#    If only acl_tbl_attr_data is present, ACL will be created/deleted based on the operation
#    If only acl_entries are present, ACL will be created/deleted based on the operation
